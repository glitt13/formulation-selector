"""qa_check_missing_huc12_divide_existence.py

QA check: for every HUC12 with no entry in the huc12<->divide_id crosswalk
(a "missing" HUC12 -- it can never receive a prediction, since
rafts_regn_params_gpkg.py's crosswalk merge is an inner join), does the
hydrofabric actually contain a divide overlapping it?

This splits "missing" HUC12s into two very different buckets:
    - no_divide_overlap: no hydrofabric divide covers any real share of this
      HUC12's own area. Likely open water, an island, or a closed/
      non-contributing basin with no flowline-connected divide to begin
      with -- probably a structural, not fixable, gap.
    - divides_exist_not_crosswalked: one or more real divides cover a
      meaningful share of this HUC12, but none of them made it into the
      crosswalk. This is a real, actionable data-coverage gap -- see
      qa_check_huc12_divide_reassignment.py for the follow-up diagnostic
      that explains *where* those divides went instead.

Coverage is measured as (intersection area) / (HUC12's own area), NOT
normalized against the divide's area. This matters because hfv4 has some
divides that are much larger than a single HUC12 -- e.g. the Everglades'
large non-contributing ("landscape"-type, no flowline) divides span many
HUC12s at once. Normalizing by the divide's footprint would make a HUC12
that's fully covered by one such divide register as a negligible sliver of
that divide's total area and get wrongly discarded as "no overlap," even
though the HUC12 itself is completely covered.

Run scoped to one region (e.g. --states FL) for a close look, or with no
--states at all for a CONUS-wide sizing pass (excludes AK/HI/PR/VI/GU/AS and
Canada/Mexico-touching HUC12s, which are out of scope for a CONUS
hydrofabric and would otherwise dominate the "missing" count for reasons
unrelated to crosswalk coverage).

Path resolution:
    --path_pred_config is the only required input. path_crosswalk_ids,
    path_gpkg_pred/pred_gpkg_lyr/pred_gpkg_id_col (the WBD HUC12 layer used
    elsewhere in this workflow, e.g. rafts_map_donor_receiver.py), and
    path_hf_finl_gpkg/layr_hf_finl_gpkg (the hydrofabric divides layer) are
    all read from that config via rafts_algo.qa_utils.

Exit code is always 0 (see scripts/qa/README.md): this is a diagnostic, not
a pass/fail gate, so it never aborts a calling shell pipeline.

Example:
    >>> cd /path/to/rafts/pkg
    >>> uv run python rafts_algo/flow/qa/qa_check_missing_huc12_divide_existence.py \\
    ...     --path_pred_config ../scripts/workflow_configs/regn_fy26_hfv4_conus_clst/regn_casam_pred_config_hf4.yaml \\
    ...     --states FL

# Changelog/Contributions
    2026-09-22 Originally created, GL
    2026-09-22 fix: normalize overlap fraction by the HUC12's own area, not the
               divide's -- hfv4's large non-contributing divides (e.g. the
               Everglades) are much bigger than a single HUC12, GL
